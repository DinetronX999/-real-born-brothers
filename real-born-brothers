    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Real Born Brothers (RBB) is a record label founded by Lil Younn. it is more than just a record label, RBB represents the streets, the pain, and the hustle behind every verse and every beat.— RBB stands for the unheard, the overlooked, and the underestimated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Founded to amplify the voices that never had a platform, RBB stands for those who were never heard. We create music for the people with raw emotoin, street wisdom, and full of passion. Whether it’s the grind, the fight, or the rise from the bottom, our sound tells real stories that can't be ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      At RBB, we don't follow trends — we define them. We're independent, we're powerful, and we’re united by one mission: 
      to give the voiceless a voice. This is not just music — this is a legacy in the making.

          He doesn’t just rap — he delivers testimony. Music is his weapon, his therapy, and his rebellion. Through his voice, 
          the unheard become heard, and the forgotten become remembered. Even with money on the table, he stays rooted in the trenches — not because he’s stuck, but because he never forgets where he came from. That’s where the soul of his sound lives.
